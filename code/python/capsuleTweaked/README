This is a munged-up version of the capsule example code from echonest-remix, ploughed together for London Music Hack Day 2010.  Copyright still belongs to EchoNest.

To use, you will need the echonest-remix package, and a valid license key.

You will need to clobber action.py in the src/echonest directory before building.  As far as I can tell, this code should have been there all along- I need to have a chat to the EchoNest dudes tomorrow.

Done all that? run:

python file1.mp3 file2.mp3 --init=0 --trans=60

you get a file out called capsule.mp3

It's 3.40am, be understanding.
